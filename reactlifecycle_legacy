For Component Mounting 

1. constructor(props)

2. componentWillMount() : This method is only called one time, which is before the initial render.
    it is called before render(). You can handle configurations here. You dont have access to 
    DOM and refs here so nothing much that can be done here, Donâ€™t call setStat, use default state instead.
    DON'T cause any side effects
    
3. render : returns jsx based on state/props, compares it to virtual DOM and then touches the DOM as needed.
We shouldn't call setState(), query the Native UI or anything else that can mutate the existing state of the application.

4. componentDidMount: componentDidMount() is the last step in mouting lifecycle phase. you can cause side effects also work with 
DOM nodes and refs
